## PS folder
### PS2 
- Audio features (PCA, ICA, NMF).
- Handwritten digit image features (PCA, ICA, NMF).
- Visualization of mapped space by PCA on handwritten digits 6.
### PS3
- Discriminant functions to classify two Gaussian distributed classes.
- Handwritten digit recognition: Learn digit classes using MNIST training data
- Speech / No speech classifier: train model with SpeechMusic dataset to classify between speech and music in a single channel mixture. 
### PS4
- Clustering on soundtrack from a TV show among "Music", "Speech", and "Audience Laughter". Implemented K-means, GMM clustering, and a HMM.
- Spoken digit classifier using self-made spoken digit dataset from 0 to 9. Implemented classifier using HMMGMM.
- Activity recognition using multi-dimensional motion-based HAR dataset ("Walking", "Walking Upstairs", "Walking Doewnstairs", "Sitting") via a VAR(Vector Auto Regressive) model.
